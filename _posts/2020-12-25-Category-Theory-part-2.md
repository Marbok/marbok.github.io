title: Category theory. Part 2. Kleisli category
categories: [Category theory]
---
*In category theory, a Kleisli category is a category naturally associated to any monad T. It is equivalent to the category of free T-algebras. The Kleisli category is one of two extremal solutions to the question Does every monad arise from an adjunction? The other extremal solution is the Eilenbergâ€“Moore category. Kleisli categories are named for the mathematician Heinrich Kleisli.* (Wikipedia). This is an example of classical definitions for category theory. But it's not so scary.

Kleisli category is a category based on monad (I'll write a separate post about monads). We can describe it like functor (a -> mb), where a, b - two types, and m - a container (monad). Standart example is logging in pure function languages.
For instance, we have two functions: upCase (translate word in upper-case) and toWords (separate string on words), and we need write log for them. In an imperative language, would likely be implemented by mutating some global state, as in (pseudocode):
``` java
String logger;

String upCase (String s) {
  logger += "upCase! ";
  return s.upCase();
}
```
But this way is bad - all developers avoid to use a global state for known reasons. We can do next:
1. Function need to return pair: function's result and string for logger.
2. Outside code compose log.

Then in Haskell:
``` sql
type Writer a = (a, String) -- it equivalent pair

-- function for composing Writers
(>=>) :: (a -> Writer b) -> (b -> Writer c) -> (a -> Writer c)
m1 >=> m2 = \x ->
  let (y, s1) = m1 x
      (z, s2) = m2 y
  in (z, s1 ++ s2)

return :: a -> Writer a -- add identity function and we get a category!
return x = (x, "")
```

For our function toUpper and toWords we get:
``` sql
upCase :: String -> Writer String
upCase s = (map toUpper s, "upCase ")

toWords :: String -> Writer [String]
toWords s = (words s, "toWords ")

process :: String -> Writer [String] -- compose function
process = upCase >=> toWords
```
If we call function process with argument "one two", then we'll get the pair, when first part is function result: ["ONE", "TWO"] and second part is log: "upCase toWords ".

Also very good example for Kleisli category is Maybe(Haskell) / Optional(Java).
