This cycle of articles is my small (or huge) experiment. I'll try to get back to the basics and learn a something new. 

I chosed ["Structure and Interpritation of Computer Program"](https://docviewer.yandex.ru/view/572626942/?*=oQ3WKsBZC9s1xsbGmSkrYd7nQfp7InVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd2ViLm1pdC5lZHUvYWxleG12LzYuMDM3L3NpY3AucGRmIiwidGl0bGUiOiJzaWNwLnBkZiIsIm5vaWZyYW1lIjp0cnVlLCJ1aWQiOiI1NzI2MjY5NDIiLCJ0cyI6MTYxMzQwMTI3NTk1MCwieXUiOiIxNTI5NjAzNDcxNjA2MjEwNDk0Iiwic2VycFBhcmFtcyI6Imxhbmc9ZW4mdG09MTYxMzQwMTI3MSZ0bGQ9cnUmbmFtZT1zaWNwLnBkZiZ0ZXh0PXNpY3ArcGRmJnVybD1odHRwcyUzQS8vd2ViLm1pdC5lZHUvYWxleG12LzYuMDM3L3NpY3AucGRmJmxyPTIxMyZtaW1lPXBkZiZsMTBuPXJ1JnNpZ249ZTdhY2E3ZWU2NjU4MWU2YTBmMjM4OWUxNGM5NmMyMTYma2V5bm89MCJ9&lang=en), because a lot of cool programmers (my idols) think that the book is the greatest! So I'll check it! But I'll use Clojure instead of Scheme, I think it's more efficient and popular in our time.

In first part, author writes a lot about syntax of Scheme (analog for Clojure [here](https://marbok.github.io/Clojure-part-1/) and [here](https://marbok.github.io/Clojure-part-2/)) and describes some base concepts.

***Recursion*** is an abstract model, where an object is part of itself. For instance, a picture with some picture inside or function, which call itself.
```clojure
(defn sum [x]
  (if (= x 0)
    0
    (+ x (sum (dec x)))))
```
It's example of ***linear recursion***. If we call this procedure `(sum 5)`, the interpreter will first create a chain (line) `(+ 5 (+ 4 (+ 3 (+ 2 (+ 1 0)))))` and then calculate it.

Similarly, we can create ***tree recursion***:
```clojure
(defn fib [n]
  (cond
    (= n 0) 0
    (= n 1) 1
    :else (+ (fib (- n 1))
             (fin (- n 2)))))
```

In general, a ***recursive process*** is characterized by the accumulation of actions and their further execution. There is also an ***iterative process***. It immediately performs the action, and accumulates the result of these actions. For instance:
```clojure
(defn sum [x]
  (let [iter [i result]
    (if (= i 0)
      result
      (recur (dec i) (+ i result)))]
    (iter x 0)))
```

Author give us many examples of high-order function (HOF) and first-class elements. ***HOF*** is a function (procedure), which can manipulate others functions: consume, produce, call. In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have ***first-class*** status. Some of the “rights and privileges” of first-class elements are:
* They may be named by variables.
* They may be passed as arguments to procedures.
* They may be returned as the results of procedures.
* They may be included in data structures
